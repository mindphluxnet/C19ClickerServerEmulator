# Installation: Game

Since the game is no longer on the Steam store you can use 
steam://install/1316610 to install it. By default it doesn't work and requires
my custom loader to run. You can find it in the Releases section of this repository; 
simply unzip it to the game directory.

# Installation: Server

Requires Node.js 12.13.x

``` 
git clone https://github.com/mindphluxnet/C19ClickerServerEmulator
cd C19ClickerServerEmulator
npm install
```

You can then start the server using

```
npm start
```

or with nodemon active

```
npm devstart
```
